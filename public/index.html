      <p><p>Over the past year I&rsquo;ve taken an interest in network automation tools and how I can apply them to my work to make tasks easier. There are low level libraries such as 
<a href="http://www.paramiko.org/" target = "_blank"><strong>Paramiko</strong></a>, a python SSH implementation, that allow you to programmatically access your devices but require lots of overhead and additional configuration. We can go up one level of abstraction to libraries such as 
<a href="https://github.com/ktbyers/netmiko" target = "_blank"><strong>Netmiko</strong></a> and
<a href="https://napalm-automation.net/" target = "_blank"><strong>NAPALM</strong></a>. These leverage connection libraries like Paramiko to manage connections to devices and interact with them. You can accomplish a lot with Netmiko/NAPALM, but you can go one step further with something like 
<a href="https://www.ansible.com/" target = "_blank"><strong>Ansible</strong></a>  to orchestrate your network and infrastructure. Ansible is widely used and has huge community support, but there are a few minor annoyances. Ansible playbooks are written in a domain specific language which makes logic complicated, it doesn&rsquo;t scale very well, and can be tricky to debug. I believe network engineers can benefit greatly from learning 
<a href="https://nornir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target = "_blank"><strong>Nornir</strong></a>. Nornir is an automation framework that is functionally very similar to Ansible, but in pure python. Because it is pure python, it is much easier to debug and extend the functionality. It has threading built in and is highly scalable. In this post I&rsquo;ll go over some basics of the Nornir framework and show the output classes that you will interact with when using it.</p></p>

      <p><p>On June 1, 2020, I passed the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C01) exam with a 940/1000 score. This was the culmination of a few months of (admittedly on and off) studying and labbing with various AWS services. Perhaps the most important thing I&rsquo;ve learned over the last year on my certification journey with Cisco and AWS is how to properly study and learn new content. Studying can be made much more efficient by avoiding common techniques that might be holdovers from high school/university. While these techniques may not be as applicable to technical topics where practical hands-on skills are required, the initial learning and memorization required to put knowledge into action will become much easier. In this post I&rsquo;ll go over the study strategies that I used for passing the AWS and the CCNP exams, as well as study tips that can be applied generally to any field.</p></p>

<p>Part of the curriculum for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate Exam includes a brief look at the VPC and its features, but it is by no means a comprehensive overview of networking in AWS. As someone who works in the networking field and has spent significant personal time labbing, I wanted to get my hands dirty with AWS networking. In this post I&rsquo;ll go over the process of setting up a site to site VPN between my home FortiGate firewall and a FortiGate EC2 instance with a public/private subnet VPC setup, with the intent of simulating a connection between an on prem network and an AWS infrastructure. I was pleasantly surprised at how intuitive this was, given that I only have experience with non cloud FortiGates, and had a ton of fun setting this up. If you have a FortiGate sitting around and are willing to spend a few cents on EC2, follow along!</p></p>

      <p><p>When learning about VLANs and layer 2 segmentation, we are always told that the purpose of VLANs is to separate broadcast domains, and traffic from one VLAN can not go to the other VLAN unless specifically allowed. However there are situations in which traffic from one VLAN can leak across to another VLAN which is a massive security risk. In this post I will show an example of VLAN hopping in the case of a native VLAN mismatch, and discuss the native VLAN in general. Note that this is geared more towards Cisco IOS, as other vendors may not implement the native VLAN in their switches.</p></p>

      <p><p>The previous post left off with questions about redistribution into OSPF areas which are also classified as stub areas. Recall that stub areas filter type 4 and 5 LSAs, while totally stubby areas filter type 3,4, and 5. So what happens if we wish to redistribute into a stubby area but keep other external routes out, or redistribute and have access to the entire network but with a minimally sized routing table and LSDB? In this post I will spin up the <a href="/1resources/images/ospfstub1/topology.PNG"><strong>lab</strong></a> (gns3 project download <a href="/1resources/misc/ospfstub1/OSPFStubArea.gns3project"><strong>here</strong></a>) from the previous post and demonstrate what are called Not So Stubby Areas, as well as various subconfigurations of NSSAs.</p></p>

      <p><p>For up and coming network engineers and those studying for their CCNA and CCNP, OSPF can be quite a daunting routing protocol. It&rsquo;s metric is much simpler than EIGRP, but the inner workings can be much more complex. Think LSAs, LSDBs, Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm, etc. Adding to this, there are various configurations that allow for certain LSA types to be filtered at different points in the network and numerous other features. The focus of this post will be those area types (called stub areas) that give network engineers more granular control of the size of their router&rsquo;s link state databases, which in turn eases resource consumption. I am assuming some familiarity with LSA types and basic OSPF concepts so I will not go over that in this discussion, however the effects of stub areas should be clear even without knowing LSAs. This post was inspired by Narbik Kocharians&rsquo; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cM3OI_ZyRuQ"><strong>video</strong></a> on the subject, which was instrumental for me in really understanding the concepts and use cases of these stub areas while studying for my CCNP ROUTE. I will demonstrate OSPF Stub Areas using a GNS3 lab and observing the changes in the routing tables/link state databases. I highly encourage everyone to follow along and lab this as well!</p></p>
