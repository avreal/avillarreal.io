<p>Part of the curriculum for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate Exam includes a brief look at the VPC and its features, but is by no means a comprehensive overview of networking in AWS. As someone who works in the networking field and has spent a lot of time labbing at home, I wanted to get my hands a bit dirty with AWS networking. In this post I&rsquo;ll go over the process of setting up a site to site VPN between my home FortiGate firewall and a FortiGate EC2 instance with a public/private subnet VPC setup, with the intent of simulating a connection between an on prem network and an AWS infrastructure. I was pleasantly surprised at how intuitive this was given I only have experience with non cloud fortigates, and had a ton of fun setting this up! If you have a FortiGate sitting around and are willing to spend a few cents on EC2, follow along!</p></p>

      <p><p>The previous post left off with questions about redistribution into OSPF areas which are also classified as stub areas. Recall that stub areas filter type 4 and 5 LSAs, while totally stubby areas filter type 3,4, and 5. So what happens if we we wish to redistribute into a stubby area but keep other external routes out, or redistribute and have access to the entire network but with a minimally sized routing table and LSDB? In this post I will spin up the <a href="/1resources/images/ospfstub1/topology.PNG"><strong>lab</strong></a> (gns3 project download <a href="/1resources/misc/ospfstub1/OSPFStubArea.gns3project"><strong>here</strong></a>) from the previous post and demonstrate what are called Not So Stubby Areas, as well as various subconfigurations of NSSAs.</p></p>

      <p><p>For up and coming network engineers and those studying for their CCNA and CCNP, OSPF can be quite a daunting routing protocol. It&rsquo;s metric is much simpler than EIGRP, but the inner workings can be much more complex. Think LSAs, LSDBs, Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm, etc. Adding to this, there are various configurations that allow for certain LSA types to be filtered at different points in the network and numerous other features. The focus of this post will be those area types (called stub areas) that give network engineers more granular control of the size of their router&rsquo;s link state databases, which in turn eases resource consumption. I am assuming some familiarity with LSA types and basic OSPF concepts so I will not go over that in this discussion, however the effects of stub areas should be clear even without knowing LSAs. This post was inspired by Narbik Kocharians&rsquo; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cM3OI_ZyRuQ"><strong>video</strong></a> on the subject, which was instrumental for me in really understanding the concepts and use cases of these stub areas while studying for my CCNP ROUTE. I will demonstrate OSPF Stub Areas using a GNS3 lab and observing the changes in the routing tables/link state databases. I highly encourage everyone to follow along and lab this as well!</p></p>
