    <p>For up and coming network engineers and those studying for their CCNA and CCNP, OSPF can be quite a daunting routing protocol. It&rsquo;s metric is much simpler than EIGRP, being just a function of reference bandwitdh vs link bandwidth. However the inner workings of OSPF can be much more complex, with its link state database (for every area) filled with LSAs of various types, and Djikstra&rsquo;s algorithm running under the hood to determine shortest paths. To add to this, there are various configurations that allow for certain LSA types to be filtered at different points in the network. The focus of this post will be those area types (called stub areas) that give network engineers more granular control over the size of their router&rsquo;s link state databases, which in turn eases resource consumption. This post was inspired by Narbik Kocharian&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cM3OI_ZyRuQ"><strong>video</strong></a> on the subject, which was instrumental for me in really understanding the concepts and use cases of these stub areas while studying for my CCNP. I will demonstrate OSPF Stub Areas using a GNS3 lab and observing the changes in the routing tables, Link State Databases, as well as using packet caputures.</p>
<p>Before getting into OSPF discussion, we must first examine the lab environment. This lab is built in GNS3 using IOU L3 images (i86bi-linux-l3-adventerprisek9-15.4.1T.bin). The full topology is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="/images/topology.png" alt="topology"></p>
<p>A couple of notes about the topology:</p>
<ol>
<li>For the purposes of this lab, the individual physical interface IP addresses do not matter, we are mostly concerned with the loopbacks configured on the routers named AreaX as well as the ASBRs (the ABRs can be ignored, I will discuss why we needed multiple routers when I discuss stub areas and redistribution).</li>
<li>x = {1,5} = {1,2,3,4,5}, so each of these routers with this notation has 5 loopbacks configured</li>
<li>The routers called AreaX are used to simulate an internal network in the specified area consisting of several routers participating in OSPF.</li>
<li>No static default routing is configured anywhere</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="initial-state">Initial State</h2>
<p>Let us first look at the initial state of the router called AREA1. As we can see the LSDB is rather large (click <a href="/textfiles/post1/area1lsdb.txt"><strong>here</strong></a> to see the full output). For this post in particular we are interested in the Type 3,4, and 5 LSAs. Note that the ouput that I am pasting here is omitting all the transit links on the network, as we are looking only at the loopbacks configured as described above. That means the LSDB is even larger than what I am showing here (14 extra type 3 LSAs)! The LSDB for Areas 1 and 2 are going to be almost exactly the same, except area 1 is going to have type 3 LSAs for area 2 and vice versa.</p>

</code></pre><h2 id="stub-configuration">Stub Configuration</h2>
<p>Now suppose that we wish to decrease the size of the database and the routing table, as our poor old router is starting to struggle with the overhead of running OSPF. We still want specific routes to the destinations within other areas, but we do not care about specific routes to the EIGRP domain. This can be accomplished by using a stub area.</p>
<p>Configuration is quite simple, we just configure</p>
<pre><code>area 1 stub
</code></pre><p>on all routers in area 1. When we do this on AREA1ABR but not AREA1 the OSPF adjaceny goes down. This is because the routers must agree no whether they will allow external routing to form the adjacency. Lets look at the OSPF hello packet once this is done.</p>
<p>Here is the hello packet from the router that does NOT have &lsquo;area 1 stub&rsquo; configured:</p>
<p><img src="/images/ospfstub1/nostubpcap.png" alt="nostub"></p>
<p>Now the packet from the rotuer that does have &lsquo;area 1 stub&rsquo; configured:</p>
<p><img src="/images/ospfstub1/stubpcap" alt="stub1"></p>
<p>Note the difference in the E bit. Once I set &lsquo;area 1 stub&rsquo; on the AREA1 router the adjacency forms again and we can observe what has changed.</p>
<pre><code>AREA1#sh ip ospf database external

            OSPF Router with ID (1.1.1.5) (Process ID 1)
</code></pre><pre><code>AREA1#sh ip route ospf | include O E2
AREA1#
</code></pre><p>What happened to the external routes and type 4/5 LSAs? Can we still reach those external networks?</p>
<p>The answer is YES, but how is this accomplished?</p>
<p>When we configured area 1 as a stub, we are essentially putting the effort of routing to external destinations solely on the ABR. This is accomplished with a special type 3 LSA propogated throughuot the network. Let us take a look at the type 3 LSAs in the database:</p>

</code></pre><p>Looks identical to the intial state except for the first entry, what is this 0.0.0.0 LSA telling us? We can take a closer look:</p>
<pre><code>AREA1#sh ip ospf database summary

            OSPF Router with ID (1.1.1.5) (Process ID 1)

                Summary Net Link States (Area 1)

  Routing Bit Set on this LSA in topology Base with MTID 0
  LS age: 108

  LS Seq Number: 80000001
  Checksum: 0xE08E
  Length: 28
  Network Mask: /0
        MTID: 0         Metric: 1
</code></pre><p>Network number of 0.0.0.0 and a network mask of 0. This looks like a default route! We can verify by looking at the routing table:</p>
<pre><code>AREA1#show ip route

Gateway of last resort is 192.168.100.1 to network 0.0.0.0

O*IA  0.0.0.0/0 [110/11] via 192.168.100.1, 00:03:09, Ethernet0/0
</code></pre><p>The AREA1ABR router has created and flooded a type 3 LSA specifying a default route to all external destinations through itself. We were able to cut the routing table and LSDB of non ABR area 1 routers in half with 2 configuration lines!</p>
<p>To summarize, in a stub area type 4 and 5 LSAs will not be propogated by the ABR. Instead the ABR will generate a type 3 LSA specifying a default route and propogate that. Now all of the non ABR routers in area 1 will have a single default route to external networks that travels through the ABR.</p>
<h2 id="totally-stubby-configuration">Totally Stubby Configuration</h2>
<p>Now suppose we want to minimize the LSDB and routing table as much as we possibly can, without having to manage static routes. OSPF gives us a method of not only stopping type 4/5 LSAS, but also limiting the propogation of type 3 LSAs. This is be called a <strong>Totally Stubby Area</strong></p>
<p>Let us hop over to area 2 for this demonstration. The LSDB is going to be nearly identical to the initial state I showed above, except IA routes to 2.2.2.2 instead are to 1.1.1.1 (in area 1).</p>
<p>The configuration is quite similar, except on the ABR we add &lsquo;no-summary&rsquo; (as in no summary LSA, you can see where this is going) to the command.</p>
<pre><code>AREA2ABR(config-router)#area 2 stub no-summary
</code></pre><p>and on the regular AREA2 router (and all other routers if they were there) we configure</p>
<pre><code>AREA2(config-router)#area 2 stub
</code></pre><p>as before.</p>
<p>Now lets look at the OSPF database in area 2.</p>
<pre><code>AREA2#sh ip ospf database

</code></pre><p>Is there a bug, did all the other routers die? NO, by configuring area 2 as a totally stubby area the ABR is NOT flooding type 3,4, or 5 LSAs within the area. Instead, as with the stub area we have a special 0.0.0.0 Type 3 LSA,</p>
<pre><code>AREA2#show ip ospf  database summary

            OSPF Router with ID (2.2.2.5) (Process ID 1)

</code></pre><p>in fact the only type 3 LSA being flooded which directs all area 2 routers to send all traffic not otherwise specified towards the ABR. Now compare the LSDB after configuring area 2 as totally stubby to the <a href="/textfiles/post1/area2lsdb.txt"><strong>initial LSDB of area 2</strong></a> and we have drastically reduced the OSPF overhead on the routers within area 2.</p>
