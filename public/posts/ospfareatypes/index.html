    <p>For up and coming network engineers and those studying for their CCNA and CCNP, OSPF can be quite a daunting routing protocol. It&rsquo;s metric is much simpler than EIGRP, but the inner workings can be much more complex. Think LSAs, LSDBs, Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm, etc. Adding to this, there are various configurations that allow for certain LSA types to be filtered at different points in the network and numerous other features. The focus of this post will be those area types (called stub areas) that give network engineers more granular control of the size of their router&rsquo;s link state databases, which in turn eases resource consumption. I am assuming some familiarity with LSA types and basic OSPF concepts so I will not go over that in this discussion, however the effects of stub areas should be clear even without knowing LSAs. This post was inspired by Narbik Kocharians&rsquo; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cM3OI_ZyRuQ"><strong>video</strong></a> on the subject, which was instrumental for me in really understanding the concepts and use cases of these stub areas while studying for my CCNP ROUTE. I will demonstrate OSPF Stub Areas using a GNS3 lab and observing the changes in the routing tables/link state databases. I highly encourage everyone to follow along and lab this as well!</p>
<p>Before getting into OSPF discussion, we must first examine the lab environment. This lab is built in GNS3 2.2.3 using IOU L3 images (i86bi-linux-l3-adventerprisek9-15.4.1T.bin). The full topology is as follows (click <a href="/1resources/images/ospfstub1/topology.PNG"><strong>here</strong></a> for full size):</p>
<p><img src="/1resources/images/ospfstub1/topology.PNG" alt="topology"></p>
<p>A couple of notes about the topology:</p>
<ol>
<li>For the purposes of this lab, the individual physical interface IP addresses do not matter, we are mostly concerned with the loopbacks configured on the routers named AreaX as well as the ASBRs.</li>
<li>x = {1,5} = {1,2,3,4,5}, so each of these routers with this notation has 5 loopbacks configured</li>
<li>The routers called AreaX are used to simulate an internal network in the specified area consisting of several routers participating in OSPF.</li>
<li>No static routing is configured.</li>
<li>I have created a gns3 portable project, that can be downloaded <a href="/1resources/misc/ospfstub1/OSPFStubArea.gns3project"><strong>here</strong></a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="initial-state">Initial State</h2>
<p>Let us first look at the initial state of the router called AREA1. As we can see the LSDB is rather large (click <a href="/1resources/textfiles/ospfstub1/area1lsdb.txt"><strong>here</strong></a> to see the full output). For this post in particular we are interested in the Type 3,4, and 5 LSAs. Note that the output that I am pasting here is omitting LSAs from the physical links on the network, as we are looking only at the loopbacks configured as described above. That means the LSDB is even larger than what I am showing here (14 extra type 3 LSAs)! The LSDB for Areas 1 and 2 are going to be almost exactly the same, except area 1 is going to have type 3 LSAs for area 2 and vice versa. (In fact the initial LSDB for all of the AREAx routers will be similar)</p>

</code></pre><h2 id="stub-configuration">Stub Configuration</h2>
<p>Suppose we want to decrease the size of the routing table by eliminating specific routes to external destinations, as the devices in this area do not care about how they reach them and only have 1 exit point anyway. We still want specific routes to the destinations within other areas in OSPF, but we do not care about specific routes to the EIGRP domain. This can be accomplished by using a stub area.</p>
<p>Configuration is quite simple, we just do</p>
<pre><code>(config-router)#area 1 stub
</code></pre><p>on all routers in area 1. When we do this on the AREA1ABR router first but not AREA1 the OSPF adjacency goes down. This is because the routers must agree on whether they will allow external routing to form the adjacency. Lets look at the OSPF hello packet once this is done.</p>
<p>Here is a piece of the hello packet from the router that does NOT have &lsquo;area 1 stub&rsquo; configured:</p>
<p><img src="/1resources/images/ospfstub1/nostubpcap.PNG" alt="nostub"></p>
<p>Now the packet from the router that does have &lsquo;area 1 stub&rsquo; configured:</p>
<p><img src="/1resources/images/ospfstub1/stubpcap.PNG" alt="stub1"></p>
<p>Note the difference in the E bit. Once I set &lsquo;area 1 stub&rsquo; on the AREA1 router the adjacency forms again and we can observe what has changed.</p>
<pre><code>AREA1#sh ip ospf database external

AREA1#
</code></pre><pre><code>AREA1#sh ip route ospf | include O E2
AREA1#
</code></pre><p>What happened to the external routes and type 4/5 LSAs? Can we still reach those external networks?</p>
<p>The answer is YES, but how is this accomplished?</p>
<p>When we configure area 1 as a stub, we are essentially putting the effort of routing to external destinations from this area solely on the ABR. This is accomplished with a special type 3 LSA propagated throughout the area. Let us take a look at the type 3 LSAs in the database:</p>

</code></pre><p>Looks identical to the initial state except for the first entry, what is this 0.0.0.0 LSA telling us? We can take a closer look:</p>
<pre><code>AREA1#sh ip ospf database summary

            OSPF Router with ID (1.1.1.5) (Process ID 1)

                Summary Net Link States (Area 1)

  Checksum: 0xE08E
  Length: 28
  Network Mask: /0
        MTID: 0         Metric: 1
</code></pre><p>Network number of 0.0.0.0 and a network mask of 0. This looks like a default route! We can verify by looking at the routing table:</p>
<pre><code>AREA1#show ip route

Gateway of last resort is 192.168.100.1 to network 0.0.0.0

O*IA  0.0.0.0/0 [110/11] via 192.168.100.1, 00:03:09, Ethernet0/0
</code></pre><p>The AREA1ABR router has created and flooded a type 3 LSA which results in the creation a default route to all external destinations through itself. We were able to cut the routing table and LSDB of non ABR area 1 routers in half with 2 configuration lines!</p>
<p>To summarize, in a stub area type 4 and 5 LSAs will not be propagated by the ABR. Instead the ABR will generate a type 3 LSA specifying a default route and propagate that. Now all of the non ABR routers in area 1 will have a single default route to external networks that travels through the ABR.</p>
<h2 id="totally-stubby-configuration">Totally Stubby Configuration</h2>
<p>Now suppose that we wish to decrease the size of the database and the routing table even further, as our poor old router is starting to struggle with the overhead of running OSPF, but we don&rsquo;t want to manage static routes. OSPF gives us a method of not only stopping type 4/5 LSAS, but also limiting the propagation of type 3 LSAs. This is called a Totally Stubby Area.</p>
<p>Lets hop over to area 2 for this demonstration. The LSDB is going to be nearly identical to the initial state I showed above, except IA routes to 2.2.2.2 instead are to 1.1.1.1 (in area 1).</p>
<p>The configuration is quite similar, except on the ABR we add &lsquo;no-summary&rsquo; (as in no summary LSA, you can see where this is going) to the command.</p>
<pre><code>AREA2ABR(config-router)#area 2 stub no-summary
</code></pre><p>and on the regular AREA2 router (and all other routers if they were there) we configure</p>
<pre><code>AREA2(config-router)#area 2 stub
</code></pre><p>as before.</p>
<p>Now lets look at the OSPF database in area 2.</p>
<pre><code>AREA2#sh ip ospf database

</code></pre><p>Is there a bug, did all the other routers die? NO, by configuring area 2 as a totally stubby area the ABR is NOT flooding type 3,4, or 5 LSAs within the area. Instead, as with the stub area we have a special 0.0.0.0 Type 3 LSA,</p>
<pre><code>AREA2#show ip ospf  database summary

            OSPF Router with ID (2.2.2.5) (Process ID 1)

</code></pre><p>in fact this is the only type 3 LSA being flooded into the area, which results in a route that directs all area 2 routers to send all traffic not otherwise specified towards the ABR. Now compare the LSDB after configuring area 2 as totally stubby to the <a href="/1resources/textfiles/ospfstub1/area2lsdb.txt"><strong>initial LSDB of area 2</strong></a> and we have drastically reduced the OSPF overhead on the routers within area 2.</p>
<p>At this point I hope this has cleared up stub areas and totally stubby areas, however the configuration above should raise some questions. For example, what if we wanted to configure an area with an ASBR as a stub? What if we wish to redistribute directly into a stub but not allow external routes from other areas? In my next post I will discuss the extension to the classic stubby areas, known as Not So Stubby Areas (seriously).</p>
