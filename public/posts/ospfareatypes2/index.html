    <p>The previous post left off with questions about redistribution into OSPF areas which are also classified as stub areas. Recall that stub areas filter type 4 and 5 LSAs, while totally stubby areas filter type 3,4, and 5. So what happens if we wish to redistribute into a stubby area but keep other external routes out, or redistribute and have access to the entire network but with a minimally sized routing table and LSDB? In this post I will spin up the <a href="/1resources/images/ospfstub1/topology.PNG"><strong>lab</strong></a> (gns3 project download <a href="/1resources/misc/ospfstub1/OSPFStubArea.gns3project"><strong>here</strong></a>) from the previous post and demonstrate what are called Not So Stubby Areas, as well as various subconfigurations of NSSAs.</p>
<h3 id="redistribution-into-stub-areas">Redistribution into Stub Areas</h3>
<p>As we saw in the previous post, configuring an area as a stub was a matter of a single config line in OSPF config mode. Now lets go to area 3 in our topology and suppose we also want that to be a stub, as we don&rsquo;t want external routes from area 4 and 5 in our routing table. Here is the initial link state database (showing only external LSAs)</p>

EIGRP3#
</code></pre><p>Now lets configure the routers in area 3 as a stub, using the &lsquo;area 3 stub&rsquo; command on all of the routers. We will start on the ASBR</p>
<pre><code>EIGRP3(config-router)#area 3 stub
EIGRP3(config-router)#
*Apr 16 22:11:45.831: %OSPF-4-ASBR_WITHOUT_VALID_AREA: Router is currently an 
ASBR while having only one area which is a stub area
EIGRP3(config-router)#
</code></pre><p>We immediately see that the ASBR throws a message about our configuration. Why is this the case? Lets configure the other routers as a stub so the adjacencies form again and then take a look.</p>
<pre><code>AREA3ABR(config-router)#area 3 stub
AREA3ABR(config-router)#end
AREA3ABR#
</code></pre><pre><code>AREA3(config-router)#area 3 stub
*Apr 16 22:19:14.152: %OSPF-5-ADJCHG: Process 1, Nbr 192.168.103.1 on 
Ethernet0/0 from FULL to DOWN, Neighbor Down: Adjacency forced to reset

*Apr 16 22:19:14.968: %OSPF-5-ADJCHG: Process 1, Nbr 192.168.103.1 on 
Ethernet0/0 from LOADING to FULL, Loading Done
AREA3(config-router)#end
AREA3#
</code></pre><p>The other 2 routers didn&rsquo;t seem to mind the configuration. Lets go back to the EIGRP3 router which has redistribution taking place, and is also an OSPF internal router in area3. Since we have configured it as a stub we know that the type 4 and 5 LSAs telling us about external destinations will not be flooded, but what about the external routes coming from the same router? Lets look at the link state database.</p>
<pre><code>EIGRP3#show ip ospf database external

            OSPF Router with ID (33.33.33.5) (Process ID 1)
EIGRP3#
</code></pre><p>The other 2 routers have the same output. So what has happened?</p>
<p>By configuring area 3 as a stub we stopped type 4 and 5 LSAs as predicted, but even those LSAs from redistribution directly into our area were stopped. As a result, the routers can still reach all external destinations (because the ABR injects a default route), except the ones being redistributed from the EIGRP3 router! (the EIGRP3 router can still reach them because they are connected routes there) When we configured the ASBR as a stub earlier, that syslog message was warning us that we have configured our ASBR as a stub where no other OSPF areas exist, so there are likely going to be adverse effects as a result of this configuration!</p>
<p>So how can we configure the internal routers in area 3 to have access to the external destinations that are being redistributed into their area, but also cut down on the size of the routing table/lsdb for other external destinations? The answer is &hellip;.</p>
<h3 id="the-not-so-stubby-area">The Not So Stubby Area</h3>
<p>Once this topological limitation became apparent, the IETF introduced a standard for a new OSPF area type in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1587"><strong>RFC 1587</strong></a>. With the Not So Stubby Area (referred to as NSSA from now on) came type 7 LSAs, which are very similar to type 5 LSAs but are only propagated within the NSSA. This allows the routers within the NSSA to populate their databases with LSAs for the redistributed routes but also limit the propagation of type 4 and 5 LSAs. Let&rsquo;s go back to the router called AREA3. The full LSDB can be accessed <a href="/1resources/textfiles/ospfstub2/area3lsdb.txt"><strong>here</strong></a>, but you can refer to the output pasted above to see the initial state.</p>
<p>Configuration is quite simple, as we did with the classic stub area we just do</p>
<pre><code>area 3 nssa
</code></pre><p>on all of the routers in the area. As with classic stub areas, neighboring routers must have the same stub configuration for the adjacency to form. This is facilitated by the OSPF hello packet option field which has an N bit that is flipped when the area is set as a nssa. When this bit is set, the E bit is unset.</p>
<p>Before setting nssa:</p>
<p><img src="/1resources/images/ospfstub2/nssa0.PNG" alt="nssa0"></p>
<p>After setting nssa:</p>
<p><img src="/1resources/images/ospfstub2/nssa1.PNG" alt="nssa1"></p>
<p>Now lets check out the LSDB of our internal area 3 router now that area 3 is a nssa.</p>
<pre><code>AREA3#sh ip ospf database external

            OSPF Router with ID (3.3.3.5) (Process ID 1)
AREA3#
</code></pre><p>As expected the type 4 and 5 LSAs are not present but wait..shouldn&rsquo;t we at least have LSAs for the redistributed routes from the EIGRP3 router? YES, but recall from above that a new LSA type was introduced specifically for NSSAs. We can see this when we run the unfiltered sh ip ospf database (or sh ip ospf database nssa-external) command:</p>
<pre><code>AREA3#sh ip ospf database

            OSPF Router with ID (3.3.3.5) (Process ID 1)

<pre><code>AREA3#sh ip route

O N2     33.33.33.5 [110/20] via 192.168.30.2, 00:25:35, Ethernet0/1
</code></pre><p>As you can see we have a new route type! OSPF N2 routes are used to specifically denote routes generated from type 7 LSAs. These type 7 LSAs are then translated into type 5 LSAs at the ABR, which are flooded through the rest of the OSPF domain. It is very important to understand that type 7 LSAs <em>only exist within a NSSA</em>.</p>
<p>Note no type 7 LSAs present on the hub router which is connected to an NSSA, they exist as type 5 here.</p>
<pre><code>HUB#sh ip ospf database nssa-external

            OSPF Router with ID (192.168.10.1) (Process ID 1)
HUB#
</code></pre><p>So we have access to the networks from the EIGRP domain now, but if you look at the routing table there is no default route as with a stub area. That is because in NSSA the default route to the ABR is optional. With the base NSSA configuration we are allowing the redistributed networks in as type 7 LSAs but not allowing type 4 or 5 LSAs, as well as not generating a default route to the other external destinations. This is because there could be paths to external destinations both through the ABR, as well as beyond the ASBR.</p>
<p>In terms of our lab, configuring area 3 as NSSA means we can reach the EIGRP3 domain, but none of the other EIGRP domains. The next sections show how this can be rectified.</p>
<h3 id="injecting-default-routes-into-nssa">Injecting Default Routes Into NSSA</h3>
<p>As we saw in the previous section, configuring an area as a NSSA allows for reachability to routes redistributed directly into the domain, but external destinations in other areas become unreachable due to the blocking of type 5 LSAs and no default route. In this section we will see a few ways to rectify that.</p>
<p>First we will go over to area 4 in our topology and look at the LSDB and routing table. Click <a href="/1resources/textfiles/ospfstub2/area4lsdb.txt"><strong>here</strong></a> for the full LSDB and <a href="/1resources/textfiles/ospfstub2/area4route.txt"><strong>here</strong></a> for the full routing table. We are interested in the type 3,4, and 5 LSAs.</p>

</code></pre><p>I have not omitted any routes or LSAs here, this is the full output! Now type 3,4, and 5 LSAs are not being flooded throughout the network with the exception of the type 3 LSA specifying a default route as an O IA route. With this configuration the routers in area 4 have full reachability to the OSPF domain, the external routes beyond the OSPF domain, as well as the directly redistributed networks.</p>
<p>However now there is a case that hasn&rsquo;t been satisfied, what if we still want specific routes to the other OSPF areas but not the external destinations, but also want reachability to everything? In this case we will go to area 5 and configure.</p>

***physical interface routes omitted, there are alot of them!***
AREA5#
</code></pre><p>Here we see that there are still type 3 LSAs, but no type 4 and 5. We also still have a default route, but now it is sent through the area as a type 7 LSA, and shows up in the routing table as an O N2 route!</p>
<p>So when do we use &lsquo;no-summary&rsquo; and when do we use &lsquo;default-information-originate&rsquo;? Generally, use &lsquo;no-summary&rsquo; when a default route from the ABR is required to reach anything within the OSPF domain (including external routes). Use &lsquo;default-information-originate&rsquo; when a default route is needed from the ABR to reach external destinations, but access to other areas may go through other routers.</p>
<p>Lets look at a special case of NSSA. Suppose that the ABR in area 5 was also an ASBR redistributing some extra loopbacks into the OSPF domain. We want these to go into area 0 and the rest of the OSPF domain but not into our NSSA. We can simply use</p>
<pre><code>area 5 nssa no-redistribution
</code></pre><p>on the ABR/ASBR.</p>
<p>This will NOT flood the redistributed routes into the NSSA domain, and they will show up in area 0 as type 5 LSAs. Here is a quick demonstration:</p>
<p>First I configure a loopback address on the AREA5ABR router, configure it to be advertised by EIGRP, then redistribute into OSPF.</p>
<pre><code>                Type-5 AS External Link States

</code></pre><p>We see it as a type 5 LSA within area 5, it is also present in the other areas. Now lets configure &lsquo;area 5 nssa no-redistribution&rsquo; on the AREA5ABR router and &lsquo;area 5 nssa&rsquo; on the others.</p>

</code></pre><p>We see that this network will be seen by everyone else.</p>
<p>As you can see, these OSPF area types are incredibly versatile, and their usage highly depends on the topology you are working with. I highly encourage everyone reading this to lab this up and try different scenarios. For example what if your internal OSPF network is connected to multiple ABRs? Can you leverage different stub configurations on those ABRs for optimal routing and even some sort of load balancing between the ABRs?</p>
